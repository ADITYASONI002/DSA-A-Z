# üìò DSA A-Z Coding Practices

Welcome to my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository.  
This repo contains code-only solutions to a wide range of DSA problems ‚Äî from basic to advanced ‚Äî as I sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## üöÄ What's Inside

- ‚úÖ Pure code solutions (no explanations or problem statements)
- üß† Covers core DSA topics:
  - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
  - Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables
  - Trees, Graphs, Heaps
  - Recursion, Backtracking
  - Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Sliding Window & more

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Language: `Your primary language here (C++)`
- IDE: `VS Code `

  
## üìå Notes

- This is a **code-only** repository ‚Äî no problem descriptions or walkthroughs.
- All problems are sourced from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio.
- Contributions are welcome if you're following a similar practice path!
